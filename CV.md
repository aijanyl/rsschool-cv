3.I graduated from the State Medical Academy, but did not start working by profession and decided to try myself in something new and chose programming. A year ago I graduated from front end courses, for a long time I did not study and now I decided to resume my studies and chose the RS school. I really hope that I can resume the activity that I really liked.
